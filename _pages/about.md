I am a first year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Sanjeev Khanna](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sanjeev/) and [Erik Waingarten](https://sites.google.com/site/erikwaing/home). My research interests lie in the design and analysis of algorithms, especially within graph theory and combinatorial optimization.

As an undergraduate, I was very fortunate to be mentored by [Chandra Chekuri](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/) and [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/).
