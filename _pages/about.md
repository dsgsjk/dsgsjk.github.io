I am a senior undergraduate student from the Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong, where I am very fortunate to work with [Prof. Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/). I spent a wonderful summer in 2023 doing research internship at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Chandra Chekuri](https://chekuri.cs.illinois.edu/).



I have a broad interest in Theoretical Computer Science. I am particularly interested in

- design and analysis of algorithms
- online and approximation algorithms
- discrete and combinatorial optimization
